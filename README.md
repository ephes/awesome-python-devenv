Just a collection of tips and tools to improve your python development experience

# macOS

Since the escape key is back, it's now possible to use macbooks as development
machines again. So I got one and had to redo my python development setup. After
some time I thought that I should write down the required steps, because
otherwise I would have to google this stuff all over again next time. After
some more time I thought that it might be a good idea to publish those steps.
Because I clearly have no clue what I'm doing and just asking for help wouldn't
be as effective as posting the wrong answer and waiting for a poor soul to take
the bait. So here we are :).

## Installing Software / Package Management

Since there's no builtin package manager in macOS, one of the first things I
usually do is to installÂ [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```shell
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
